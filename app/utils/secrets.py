"""Password hashing and secret sealing.

Passwords and API keys are hashed with argon2id (memory-hard, deliberately
slow) — a plain SHA-256 of a low-entropy password is a rainbow table waiting to
happen, and a leaked DB should not hand over partner credentials.

The webhook subscription secret is a different animal: we need it back to sign
outgoing deliveries, so it cannot be hashed. It is sealed instead —
authenticated encryption with a key the database does not have. A leaked DB
yields ciphertext only; the key lives in configuration.

Both halves keep the ability to recognise a legacy SHA-256 digest so existing
rows can be upgraded on the next login instead of every partner being forced
through a reset: a hash that has to be re-derived to be checked is checked, and
then replaced in place.
