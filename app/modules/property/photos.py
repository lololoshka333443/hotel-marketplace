"""Property photo storage.

Photos arrive as multipart uploads from the partner cabinet and leave as two
WebP files: a full size (long edge capped) and a card thumb. The DB keeps the
order (first photo = the listing's cover) as a jsonb array of
``{"id", "full", "thumb"}`` on ``property.photos``.

Security rules this module owns:

- The filename is **never** taken from the client: the stored name is a server
  generated id, so nothing the partner sends can reach the filesystem as a path
  component.
- The type is sniffed from magic bytes, not the declared ``Content-Type`` — a
  ``.jpg`` rename does not make a file a JPEG.
- The image is re-encoded with Pillow: a file that does not decode is rejected,
  and the bytes that hit disk are ours, not the partner's.
- Ownership is checked on every write the way the rest of the cabinet does it
  (``WHERE partner_id = $2``) — another partner's property answers 404.
- The count limit is enforced inside the same UPDATE that appends, so two
  concurrent uploads cannot both slip past it.
