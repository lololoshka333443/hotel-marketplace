"""Outbox delivery loop.

Same shape as the reaper and the iCal poller: a tolerant forever loop that
claims a batch, does the slow network work outside any transaction, and never
lets one bad iteration kill the next one.

Delivery states:
  pending      -> waiting for a slot
  delivering   -> claimed, HTTP in flight
  published    -> every subscriber answered 2xx (or there were none)
  failed       -> max_attempts reached; dead-lettered for manual retry
