"""Admin service: staff authentication + property moderation.

Moderation model (Phase 1): partners may self-publish (tested behavior), so the
admin queue is oversight, not a gate. Admins see every property by status and
can block / unblock; pending_moderation is the formal submission state that
'approve' resolves. Commission is read-only here - it is snapshotted at
confirmation time and never recomputed (see report.py).
