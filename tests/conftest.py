"""Shared pytest fixtures.

The tests run against their own database, not the developer's.

The old suite cleaned the dev database after each test — a `committed_conn`
test wipes every row of every table in `hotel_mp`. That worked, but it made
`pytest` and `seed_demo.py` mutually exclusive: every test run destroyed the
demo content the frontend was developed against, so the DB had to be re-seeded
before the app was usable again.

The suite now creates and migrates `hotel_mp_test` once per session and drops
it again on the way out. The dev database is never touched, so `pytest` and
`seed_demo.py` no longer fight over the same rows.

Two DB fixtures:

- `db_conn`: connection inside a transaction that is always rolled back.
  Used by unit tests that must leave nothing behind.

- `committed_conn`: connection in autocommit mode with explicit cleanup.
  Used by tests whose code path opens its own transactions (payment service),
  which cannot nest inside an outer rollback.
