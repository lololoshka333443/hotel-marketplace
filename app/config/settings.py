    # ----- Outbox sharding -----
    # The queue is sliced into this many logical shards by the property the
    # event is about (hashtext % this, computed in SQL). Each delivery worker
    # owns a disjoint subset, so delivery parallelises and one partner's burst
    # never sits in another's claim order. Changing this needs a re-backfill of
    # the shard column — old rows keep their value, so nothing breaks, only the

    # hashed. The DB holds ciphertext only; this key is the difference between
    # a leaked table and a leaked secret. Generate with:
    #   python -c "from cryptography.fernet import Fernet; print(Fernet.generate_key().decode())"
    # Rotation re-seals every existing secret: keep the outgoing key in
    # webhook_seal_key_previous and unseal falls back to it, so deliveries keep
    # working while scripts/rotate_seal_key.py walks the rows. Drop the previous
    # key once the script reports nothing left on the old one.

    webhook_seal_key_previous: str = Field(default="")

    # ----- Webhook delivery retention -----

    # and ages out on a schedule (app/modules/outbox/retention.py) — never in
    # a request, never wholesale.

    # the booking itself is the source of truth, so they go first.

    # when a partner claims a booking never arrived.

    # Partitions are created this many months ahead so a delivery never waits
    # on missing DDL.

    # ----- Property photos -----

    # swap only changes these two.
